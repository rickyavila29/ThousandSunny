# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Post-Assigment review

This assigment showed me where I was lacking practice in my HTML and CSS 
as well as gave me a chance to explore in depth the elements and selectors that can be used to create a stylish web page.
This portfolio is an exciting task since I will be able to see the fruition of adding projects over the course of the months to come.
I think the main purpose of this assigment was to get the students comfortable with using HTML and CSS
while at the same time allowing us to develop our portfolio in order to prepare us for the job market.
