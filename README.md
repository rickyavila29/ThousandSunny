# Challenge-2
This project enabled us to create a portfolio which we will later develop the further our knowledge progresses.
Using a variety of techniques we have learned in class I was able to create a portfolio with images, links, info, etc.
The portfolio will allow me to use what ive learned to link other projects, contact information, and other information about myself.
